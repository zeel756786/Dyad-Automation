 * server's static file handler then 404s on when the browser requests it
 * (on Windows), even though the file genuinely exists on disk — a
 * plain-ASCII-named file in the same directory serves fine. Every
 * screenshot/log/content-validation attachment in every report in this repo
 * was silently unreadable in the browser because of this (step titles
 * routinely contain "—", and every attachment name here is built from one).
 * Strips it (and a few of the same "fancy Unicode punctuation" family, on
 * the same suspicion) down to plain ASCII before it ever reaches
 * `testInfo.attach()`. This only affects the attachment *name* — the step
 * `title` Playwright shows in the UI, and any `—` inside `log`/prose text
 * (file *content*, not a *filename*), are completely unaffected.

/**
 * A `test.step()` wrapper that makes the HTML report self-explanatory without
 * having to open a trace: every step gets a human-readable log line (what
 * was searched for / uploaded / confirmed, including the specific values
 * involved — not just the static step title) and a full-page screenshot
 * taken right after the step's action/assertions complete, both attached so
 * they render inline in the Playwright HTML report under that step.
 *
 * `log` is evaluated *after* `action()` resolves, so it can describe the
 * actual runtime value involved (e.g. the real batch number found), not just
 * the static step title. Pass a plain string when there's nothing dynamic to
 * report, or a callback returning one build from `action()`'s result.
 *
 * `highlight` names the specific element(s) this step actually validated.
 * Each one gets a visible colored outline box drawn directly into the page
 * (so it shows up in the screenshot below) and has its live `textContent`
 * read and attached as a "content validation" log — a second, independent
 * record of what was actually on screen, distinct from `log`'s prose
 * summary. An element that can't be found/read is recorded as such rather
 * than silently skipped, so a report reader can tell "validated, text was
 * X" apart from "couldn't even locate this element".
 *
 * Confirmed live 2026-09-28: this does NOT use Playwright's own
 * `locator.highlight()` — that API only supports one highlighted element at
 * a time (calling it a second time silently replaces the first box, it
 * doesn't add a second one; confirmed by counting the DOM node it injects
 * across multiple calls), so any step passing more than one `highlight`
 * target would have shown only its last one. Draws independent boxes via a
 * plain `getBoundingClientRect()`-positioned overlay `<div>` per target
 * instead, so every target in the array stays visible simultaneously.
